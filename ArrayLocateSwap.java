/*Write a program to locate and swap only 2 elements which are not sorted in a given sorted array. 
For example given an array {1,2,5,6,4} locate 5 and 4 and then swap them as they are not as per sorted order.
  	   logic is traverse from rightmost side and find the first out of order element (element which is smaller than previous element). 
  	   Once first element is found, find the other our of order element by traversing the array toward left side.*/
